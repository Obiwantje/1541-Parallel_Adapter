# 1541-Parallel_Adapter
(This is still untestet, but should work)
This is an adapter to easier add a parallel port for the Commodore 1541 and 1541-II diskette drive.

Item list.
* 15CM 10 wire flatcable.
* 15pin D-sub female(not the VGA type), either solder or for IDC ribbon cable (last one recommended).
* 40 pins IC socket.
* 2 x 20 pins sil header male-male. (turned/tulip recommended).

All items can be found on eBay or your favorite electronics pusher.

Pin 1 from the PCB connects to Pin 1 of the D-sub connector, 2 to 2 etc.

**Let the PCB be as thin as possible. Testet is a 0.8mm thick adapter.**

Washers is needed for the 1541-II drive to lift the mechanical parts.
1.6mm (2 x 0.8mm) height with an inner diameter of 4mm is sufficient to lift the drive.
